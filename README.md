# Carbon-Chronicle-Investigating_GHG_Emissions_Trends
The objective of this project is to analyze trends in CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide by creating data visualizations using the dataset provided by Our World in Data

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, and understanding global greenhouse gas emissions trends is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. Our World in Data provides a comprehensive dataset on CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions, encompassing various metrics such as annual emissions, per capita emissions, and cumulative emissions. This project aims to analyze this dataset to gain insights into global emissions patterns, identify key contributors to emissions, and assess the impact of emissions on climate change.

<h2>Objective</h2>

The primary objective of this project is to analyze trends in CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide using the dataset provided by Our World in Data. Specific objectives include:

- Examining trends in annual CO2 emissions and assessing the factors driving these trends.
- Analyzing per capita emissions to understand the distribution of emissions across different countries.
- Investigating cumulative emissions to assess historical contributions to the global carbon budget.
- Exploring the relationship between emissions and other socio-economic factors such as population, GDP, and energy consumption.
- Assessing the impact of emissions on global temperature change and climate variability.
